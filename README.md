# AutoBots
## The opinionated framework for agentic engineering.

## Core Principles
### 1. Test-Driven Development is the key to our foundation.
Always start with a failing test.
### 2. The longest part of software development is not producing code.
Aint nobody got time for that.
### 3. Agent-produced code doesn't have to be garbage.
Read it and weep.
### 4. Aint nobody got time for that.
Aint nobody got time for that. 

## Install
```
brew install autobots
```

## Usage
```
autobots assemble .
```

## Background
Historically, contract-driven development, or [design-by-contract (DbC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract), has been poorly adopted despite some distinct advantages. CDD promises to cleanly architect, test, and document software, however, the activation energy required to implement it is too high for most organizations.

AutoBots aims to solve this problem by providing an open-source, AI-powered platform for achieving CDD & TDD at scale.
